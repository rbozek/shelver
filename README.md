Are you a music lover?

Do you listen to albums all the way through, from front to back?

Have you ever had a real-life, hold-this-thing-in-your-hands music collection? (Vinyl? CD's? Tapes? Wax cylinders?)

In an age dominated by music streaming services -- Shelver is here to help you! Add any album you like to the public shelf to make it accessible to any future user. Then save any album into your personal collection - your Shelf - where you'll curate your own library that you can always refer back to. No longer will those obscure albums be lost to time.

More philosophy & artsy-fartsy thoughts on Shelver's "about" page, if you're interested.

## :memo:	Notes
- User might notice that an album's details will be editable by any logged in user, not only the user who created it. This is intentional - if music lovers use this site, my hope is that any album edits made will be in the spirit of accuracy, and for the benefit of all other users. Consider it an experiment in trust. :slightly_smiling_face:	

## :wrench:	Basic Improvements (a.k.a. not quite Ice Box)

- make the display mobile-friendly!
- add display to show which user last edited an album
- add sorting options for any shelf page - alpha, date, etc.
- incorporate tracklists/songlists to albums
- add profile view for a user where they can see their personal info, and any reviews they've left

## :ice_cube::boxing_glove: Ice Box Features 

- incorporate musicians to albums
- incorporate producers to albums
- incorporate album cover artwork
- add option for different media formats for personal libraries - vinyl, digital download, stream, CD, tape, 8-track, etc
- add other suggested artists or albums to an album's detail page
- add another "To Listen" shelf, for user to track albums they haven't heard yet
- expand to other media - books, movies, etc.
